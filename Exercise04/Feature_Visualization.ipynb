    "We are interested in theinput occlusion technique. The main idea is to systematically cover parts of the input witha gray box and measure how much the output(classification score) changes at each location. The change is measured relatively to the actual (initial) prediction score of the trained model, given the same input. The intuition is that the rate of change in the output suggests the importance of the occluded region. Every square shown in the image was occludedonce and the rate of change of the classification (class sax, saxophone) was measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is shown as a simple heatmap on the right and superimposed on the image on the left. One can see that the actual saxophone is highly important for the image to be classified as sax, saxophone. Although the network was never told what to look at, it learned what part of the image makes it classify as saxophone, therefore, it learns a coarse localization of objects.\n",
